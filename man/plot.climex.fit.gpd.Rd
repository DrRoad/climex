\usage{
\method{plot}{climex.fit.gpd}(x, bin.factor = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Fitted GEV object.}

\item{bin.factor}{Multiplying the length of x
by this factor, results in the number of bins
used in this plot. Default = NULL}
}
\value{
ggplot2 object.

\details{
Uses ggplot2. Since I will also use it
in the shiny app, where I want to adjust the number
of displayed bins, there is a second argument present.
