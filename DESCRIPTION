Description: This package has three purposes: 1. it provides a webscrapper easing the pain of downloading the daily station data of the German weather service, 2. it provides robust and easy to use functions for the Maximum Likelihood fitting of GEV and GP distributions and 3. it contains a shiny app enabling the user to analyse a large amount of data interactively and to check the validity of the fitting results (avoidance of local minima).
